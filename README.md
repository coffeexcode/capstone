## About
This repository contains, or references, all source code relevant to the ConAssist Capstone project for group Big Yikes.

## Roadmap

For references from SRS to relevant code, see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Our group determined that the most sane option for a full-stack web and mobile service like ConAssist to meet the requirement of linking to our SRS document was through references from *all* Pull Requests to the section in the SRS document they are meant to address. 

### Labels

For categorized Pull Requests you can filter by labels on Github. For example, if you want to see changes related to the requirement for an administrative website, use the `admin website` label.

### Backend Services
**QR Code Management System**

See project located in repository [`github.com/coffeexcode/RestfulQr`](https://github.com/coffeexcode/RestfulQr), or through the submodule here located under `/restfulqr`.

### Scripts

The scripts directory contains individual scripts for purpose in any projects *development* or *testing*. Each script should be in it's own directory with a corresponding README.md file to explain it's purpose and usage. This, as opposed to inline documention in comments, allows for node or python scripts with dependency folders.
