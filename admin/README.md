## About the Service

Our admin site, for the purposes of this proof of concept, contains our tools
for adminstrating your event from an organizer point of view. This largely pertains to viewing statistics about who is going to your event and, if applicable, who has applied for your event. 

The majority of pages are designed for tracking and managing these relevant statistics.
